The MET website [Demo](https://melnyksergey7.github.io/MET-landing-page/) is a comprehensive platform that provides all the necessary information about the museum, including its location, hours of operation, and detailed information about the exhibitions currently on display. You can access the website on your mobile phone as it is adaptive. You can also book your place for an exhibition by calling the museum directly.
